"""Parsing and structural interpretation module for C files. 

This module holds functions and classes serving the purpose of parsing C files containing information 
about the structure of packets and commands. The parsing in general happens mostly by recognising (a subset of)
standard C-syntax and the system of Python representations of C-objects tries to include all possible information
present in the C file, which makes it perhaps a bit too convoluted.
