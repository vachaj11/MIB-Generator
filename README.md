A set of python scripts that create a SCOS 2000[^1] MIB database from inputted C-header files. It includes basic abilities for 1. parsing of C syntax, 2. interpreting it along the lines of expected structure of monitoring and telecommunication packet declarations and 3. creating corresponding MIB databases.

The code is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/vachaj11/MIB-Generator) and releases are published on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mib-generator).

For instruction on installation/building and usage or more general information about the project see the documentation hosted on [Read The Docs](https://mib-generator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
