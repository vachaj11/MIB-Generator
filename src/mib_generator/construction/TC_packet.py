"""Module holding Python representations of TC packets, TC header and the corresponding MIB tables.

This module takes care of creating a representation of TC commands from parsed sections of C-files and extracting 
entries for MIB databases. These classes represent the TC commands only in the sense that they hold in a structured
form any possible information that could be found relating to that command including the entries in various MIB tables that
correspond to it.
