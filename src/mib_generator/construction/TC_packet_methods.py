"""Methods for creation of TC MIB tables and internal representation of TC command packets in general.

This module holds methods that help with formatting of parsed data into TC packet and commands characteristics. They are usually
concerned with value evaluation, bite counting, type identification etc. I.e. mostly kind of housekeeping jobs.
