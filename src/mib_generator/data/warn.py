"""Takes care of warning and errors that can be raised by the rest of the program.

This module holds both definition of all the errors and warnings that can occur throughout and a method that can be used to 
raise them. (This is made this centralised so that the raising method can be easily changed later if e.g. the UI changes.)

Attributes:
    warnings (dict): A dictionary containing the text definitions of all the possible warnings.
    errors (dict): A dictionary containing the text definitions of all the possible errors.
    complete (dict): A dictionary containing the text definitions of all the possible completion messages.
    display (None or some object): Defines (or holds the object) where the warnings should be raise.
