"""This module works as a startpoint and a junction for creation of the MIB databases.

This module through its :obj:`main` method serves the role of a logical centre of the whole program. It interchanges
appropriate files between sub-packages, calls appropriate methods for each task, etc. See :obj:`main` for more info.

    """Run this whole hellish thing.

    This method holds the main logic of the whole program. Roughly it sequentially does this:

        1. If the appropriate option is raised, run script to update the input/output paths in default/specified directory.
        2. If the appropriate option is raised, run script to update the config file in default/specified directory.
        3. Load the configuration file into the runtime directory (:obj:`mib_generator.temp`).
        4. Initialise the :obj:`mib_generator.parsing.load` module which automatically parses the files at
           the specified paths.
        5. Unless construction is disabled, call appropriate construction scripts and receive
           Python representation of all the calibrations, TM-packets, TC-commands, etc. that
           occur in the parsed files.
        6. Perform some checks that these objects (mainly TM-packets and calibrations) are linked
           in a correct way.
        7. Unless generation is disabled, call the generation script which turns all previously
           constructed objects into MIB tables and saves them.
        8. If the appropriate option is raised, generate a document summing up the interpreted TM/TC packages.
        9. If the appropriate option is raised, show the parsed files' contents in a GUI visualisation.

    Args:
        visual (bool): ``True`` if the GUI visualisation of the parsed files should be shown, ``False`` otherwise (and by
            default).
        generate (bool): ``True`` (by default) if the MIB tables should be generated and saved from the constructed
            Python representations, ``False`` otherwise.
        parseonly (bool): ``True`` if only parsing of the C-files should be done and none of the subsequent steps.
            ``False`` otherwise and by default.
        paths (bool): ``True`` if the script to update the input/output paths should be run, ``False`` otherwise (and by
            default).
        config (bool): ``True`` if the script to update the config file should be run, ``False`` otherwise (and by default).
        generate_t (bool): ``True`` if the ``.docx`` document summing up the processed TM and TC packets is to be generated,
            ``False`` otherwise.
        custom_dir (str): A string specifying the path to a directory where the configuration files on basis of which this
            program runs, are located.

    Returns:
        bool: ``True`` if the script finished successfully, ``None`` otherwise.
