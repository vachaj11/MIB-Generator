"""This subpackage does a sort of administrative work around the other sub-packages. It doesn't contain any program logic
itself but it calls it from other parts of the code and provides an joint interface for it that the user can interact with.

Included submodules:

    * :obj:`main` - Module that contains all the logic communicating and passing data between components from other
      subpackages.
    * :obj:`cli` - Module that provides a simple CLI interface that can be called from the terminal and which the user can
      interact with.
